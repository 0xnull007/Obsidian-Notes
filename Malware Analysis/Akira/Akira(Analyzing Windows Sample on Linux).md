`trid`, `file`  ---> To analyze file type
`clamscan` ---> AV to scan the sample, it may tell us the family of the virus by matching its signature with all the malware signatures present in its local database. So, its better to update its database before scanning using command `freshclam`.
`signsrch` ---> To search for important signatures through the binary
`peframe` ---> It mimics to run the sample and tells us about suspicious functions calls and behaviors.
`strings` ---> can be used to extract strings from binary, you can try different encoding too
`xorsearch`, `brxor.py` ---> to search obfuscated strings within the sample. i.e, `xorsearch win.exe http`, `brxor.py win.exe`
`bbcrack`, `floss` ---> advance obfuscated strings searching tools
